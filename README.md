John Conway's Game of Life. Uses C and SDL2. This is
practice with bit manipulation. Instead of using a char to
store the state of one tile I will use the entire char.
The tile's state will be stored in a single bit of a char
allowing me to use as much of my allocated memory as
possible. Not really worth much but pretty cool.

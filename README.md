This is a bit manipulation test that uses C, SDL2, and Game of Life.
This is practice with bit manipulation. Instead of using a char to
store the state of one tile I will use the char to store
multiple tile states. The tile's state will be stored in a
single bit of a char allowing me to use as much of my allocated
memory as possible. Not really worth much but pretty cool.
